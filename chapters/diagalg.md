# Diagnostic Algorithms

## The structure of diagnostic algorithms

Diagnostic algorithms are commonly represented in medical journals and textbooks as decision trees.

## Formalizing diagnostic algorithms

We want users to be able to collaborate on diagnostic algorithms. In order to achieve this goal, we need to establish some conventions for representing them.

## Collaborating on diagnostic algorithms

### Referencing the literature

#### Acceptable sources

DOIs provide permalinks to academic papers. However, papers tend to have moremore detail than needs to be referenced on a day-to-day basis in the clinic. UpToDate articles contain information in a more clinically useful style, but each article is so general that it may be difficult to link directly to and extract specific facts.

#### Direct vs Indirect citation


### JSON vs Markdown

JSON is immediately usable by the MongoDB, but Markdown is more human-readable. We may eventually prefer to make use of Markdown as the canonical format for storing diagnostic algorithms
